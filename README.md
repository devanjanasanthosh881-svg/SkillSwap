PROBLEM STATEMENT
India has millions of people who want to learn new skills, but:
Quality education and skill training is expensive
Many skilled individuals have knowledge but no platform to teach
There is no structured peer-to-peer skill exchange system
Rural and urban talent remain disconnected
As a result, valuable knowledge remains unused while learners struggle to access affordable opportunities.

SOLUTION
SkillSwap India is a peer-to-peer digital platform where:
Users register and list skills they can teach
Users list skills they want to learn
The system intelligently matches users based on mutual skill needs
Users connect and exchange knowledge without monetary barriers
It creates a collaborative learning ecosystem across India.
Tagline:
“Learn What You Want. Teach What You Love.”
